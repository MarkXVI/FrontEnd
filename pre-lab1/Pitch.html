    <h1>Dear client/ customer,</h1>
    <p>
        My name is <b>Mark Harvey</b> and I am 22 years old. 
        I am currently studying to become a software developer at Kristianstad University. 
        <br><br>
        I believe that I would be a great fit for any team because I play well with others, 
        I can adapt quickly to resolve many situations and I am very willing to work to get any job done.
        I am also a creative, fast learning programmer that is eager for new way and better ways to improve. 
        <br><br>
        I am most experienced with writing code in python and java, although I am fairly quick at picking up new languages to work with.
